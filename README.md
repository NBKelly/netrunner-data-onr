# Goal

Convert the ONR cards into a format usable by Jinteki. 

The cards will be placed under the factions "onr_corp" and "onr_runner", and all the card titles will be prefaced by "onr_" to maintain compatability.

Types will be mapped to the android: netrunner counterparts, and two new IDs will be added.

# netrunner-cards-edn

The clojure app is internal only, p much. If you want the edn data, look under `/edn`.
This app only transforms that data into a jnet-usable format.
